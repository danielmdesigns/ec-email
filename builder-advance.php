      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>Builders typically offer buyer’s agents a traditional 3% commission. Under the program, agents would be given a choice: Receive 3% but wait until closing to get paid. Or choose Builder Advance and receive 2.5% but have their commission wired to
        their bank within a few hours.*<br><br> If choosing Builder Advance, the Builder uses the .5% reduction to offset the cost of the advance which is a flat fee of 25%, and due only when the sale closes. Here’s an example:
